\section{Literature Review}
\textit{What is the problem to be solved, and it's significance?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brief background to project
    \item Summary of literature relevant to project
    \item Identification of "gaps" in the literature
\end{itemize}}

The literature review is not just about presenting descriptions of the important papers you have found, but telling a meaningful story and, where appropriate, some critical discussion of previous findings (i.e. was another study useful but flawed?). Remember that you may read hundreds of papers/books/web pages etc., but often only about 20 or 30 are really important, and these are the ones you will mention in your literature review, which this report will be a concise version of. This section needs to flow logically, and this does not always imply that the material is chronological. By the end, the reader should have a clear appreciation of what the major work in the field was, why it is relevant to the current project, and where the unknowns and questions lie (\textbf{research gaps}) – these are the issues that you are going to address with your thesis research.

For the purposes of this report, this section will be \textbf{12-15 pages long}. Remember to reference properly any material that you obtain from literature or other sources. If you are unsure how to discuss literature properly, find a really good review paper on your topic, or if there isn’t one, a similar topic, and you will have a good example to refer to.

\subsection{Principles of Photovoltaic Modules}
\subsubsection{What are photovoltaic modules?}
Photovoltaic modules, also known as solar panels, are devices that convert sunlight into electrical energy.\vspace{0.5em}

\subsubsection{What is the photoelectric effect?}
Light is made up of massless particles called photons which possess a certain amount of energy. When these photons strike the surface, they knock electrons off it, which are known as photoelectrons. This is known as the photoelectric effect.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent The photoelectric effect will only occur if the radiation's frequency is greater than the threshold frequency of the metal. The work function refers to the minimum amount of energy needed to remove an electron from a metal surface. If photons with enough energy hit the surface, they can transfer their energy to the electrons allowing them to escape. If the energy of the incident photons is less than the work function, no electrons will be emitted, regardless of the intensity of the light.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent The work function and threshold frequency are closely related:
\begin{equation}
    E = hf_0
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E$ is the work function.
    \item ($h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{34}$ joule-second) is Planck's constant.
    \item $f_0$ is the threshold frequency.
