\section{Literature Review}
% \textit{What is the problem to be solved, and it's significance?
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Brief background to project
%     \item Summary of literature relevant to project
%     \item Identification of "gaps" in the literature
% \end{itemize}}

% The literature review is not just about presenting descriptions of the important papers you have found, but telling a meaningful story and, where appropriate, some critical discussion of previous findings (i.e. was another study useful but flawed?). Remember that you may read hundreds of papers/books/web pages etc., but often only about 20 or 30 are really important, and these are the ones you will mention in your literature review, which this report will be a concise version of. This section needs to flow logically, and this does not always imply that the material is chronological. By the end, the reader should have a clear appreciation of what the major work in the field was, why it is relevant to the current project, and where the unknowns and questions lie (\textbf{research gaps}) – these are the issues that you are going to address with your thesis research.

% For the purposes of this report, this section will be \textbf{12-15 pages long}. Remember to reference properly any material that you obtain from literature or other sources. If you are unsure how to discuss literature properly, find a really good review paper on your topic, or if there isn’t one, a similar topic, and you will have a good example to refer to.

\subsection{Principles of Photovoltaic Modules}
\subsubsection{What are photovoltaic modules?}
Photovoltaic modules, commonly known as solar panels, are devices that convert sunlight into electrical energy. \cite{EnelGreenPower2025PhotovoltaicModule}\vspace{0.5em}

\subsubsection{What is the photoelectric effect?}
Sunlight is made up of massless particles called photons which possess a certain amount of energy. When these photons strike the surface, they knock electrons off of it, known as photoelectrons. This is known as the photoelectric effect.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent The photoelectric effect will occur only if the frequency of the radiation is greater than the threshold frequency of the metal. The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of light that causes electrons to be emitted from a material. The proportional relationship that exists between the threshold frequency and the work function is shown in Equation \ref{eq:workfunction} below:
\begin{equation}
    E = hf_0
    \label{eq:workfunction}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $E$ is the work function.
    \item ($h = 6.62607015 \times 10^{34}$ joule-second) is Planck's constant.
    \item $f_0$ is the threshold frequency. 
\end{itemize}\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent The work function refers to the minimum amount of energy needed to remove an electron from a metal surface. If photons with enough energy hit the surface, they can transfer their energy to the electrons allowing them to escape. If the energy of the incident photons is less than the work function, no electrons will be emitted, regardless of the intensity of the light.\vspace{0.5em}

\subsubsection{How do photovoltaic modules work?}
A photovoltaic module is made up of multiple photovoltaic cells, commonly known as solar cells. Each photovoltaic cell is made of semiconductor material, which is placed between the conductive layers. The most common semiconductor material used to make photovoltaic cells is silicon, accounting for 95 percent of photovoltaic modules sold worldwide. These photovoltaic cells use the photovoltaic effect to convert solar energy into electrical energy.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent As shown in Figure \ref{fig:photovoltaic_cell_diagram}, a silicon photovoltaic cell is composed of two different layers of silicon: an n-type silicon layer, which has additional electrons, and a p-type silicon layer, which has extra spaces for the electrons, called holes.\par

\noindent When a proton strikes the silicon photovoltaic cell with the required energy, an electron is knocked out of its bond. Because of the electric field at the p-n junction, the negatively charged electron moves toward the n-side, while the resulting positively charged hole is attracted to the p-side. The free electrons are collected by thin metal fingers positioned at the top of the photovoltaic cell, before travelling through an external circuit. After electrical work is performed, the electrons are returned to the conductive aluminium sheet positioned at the back of the photovoltaic cell. Since electrons follow a continuous cycle and are the only moving components, there is no wear and tear, allowing photovoltaic cells to last for decades. However, they still have limitations.\vspace{0.5em}
