\section*{Appendix}

Add in the appendices any material which supports this document, but does not “fit” naturally in the flow of your report’s narrative.

Place here your Gantt chart with detailed activities (to be referred to in the project plan section). Feel free to put it in “sideways” to fit better. In the appendix, the more detail the better – make realistic dates and specific milestones, you should have a good idea by now what you need to do and how you’re going to do it... if not, you definitely need to discuss with your supervisor as soon as possible.

Also remember to add your draft thesis outline in the appendices. This is in the form of a table of contents of the Thesis, with detailed sub-section headings linked to your research topic and planned activities.
